## Files in this directory:
Final sequence files used in manuscript

- `Sample_labels.csv`: file showing the label on final trees vs. initial data processing (and .fasta/.nxs files herein)
- `coi_aligned.fasta`: fasta file of aligned coi sequences
- `coi_aligned.nxs`: nexus file of aligned coi sequences
- `concat_aligned.fasta`: fasta file of aligned concatenated genes (11 mt genes)
- `concat_aligned.nxs`: nexus file of aligned concatenated genes (11 mt genes)

- `.fasta` and `.nxs` files used in all analyses (post-alignment)

- includes a file that has the label in the `.fasta`/`.nxs` files compared to the labels in the final trees (`Sample_labels.csv`)
